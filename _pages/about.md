I am a research assistant with **Dr. Ming-Chung Chang** at the Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica. Before joining Academia Sinica, I earned a Master’s degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2024 and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from National Tsing Hua University in 2023. For more details about my background, please refer to my CV.

# Research Interest
My general research lies in the intersection of **machine learning** & **statistics**, focused on collaboration, prediction, and interoperability. Here are some keywords that best describe my previous research projects:
- Sequential Decision Making
- Collaborative and Federated Learning
- Explainable AI

# Academic Advisors
- I am extremely fortunate to have been advised by [Dr. Ming-Chung Chang](https://sites.google.com/view/mcchang/), an Associate Research Fellow at the Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, during my senior year as a Mathematics student. He has guided my journey into the field of statistics from then until now.
- During my master's studies, I am very pleased to be advised by [Prof. Raed Al Kontar](https://alkontar.engin.umich.edu/), an Associate professor at the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We collaboratively developed two papers on sequential decision-making, which sparked my interest in this field.
